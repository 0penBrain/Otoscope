Otoscope
========

This project aims to create a research-validated otoscope whose plans are
available freely and openly. The goal price is approximately USD$3 in parts.

This design is based on current gold-standard designs of premium-brand
otoscopes.

The original design and work is by the talented Frankie Talarico. The license
is TAPR OHL where applicable.
