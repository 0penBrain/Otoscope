In this word document, I will outline the steps to manufacturing part of the E4R View 2 otoscope.  This part includes creating the main otoscope piece, including the otoscope head, neck, and battery area.  It does not include the lens creation and the handle painting/prepping.  
Parts:








Prepare battery compartment and neck piece; sand the bottom of the neck piece and the square holder area of the battery holder. Sand the connector appendage until a tight fit. 










Super glue the neck piece and the battery compartment











Prepare battery holder








Rough bottom of store bought battery holders (for better super glue hold).  Feed postivie and negative wires through holes. 









Super glue the store bought battery holders to the battery compartments.  Ensure the positive wire is placed through the wire slot in the battery holder. 










Prepare button.
	
Feed button wires through the button holder.  Placed button in the button holder and super glue.





Solder one button wire to the positive wire from battery holders. 








Create the LED chamber.





I placed a 220 ohm pull-up resistor here, I took this out after the fact because the lights were too dim. 











Super glue LED chamber bottom half. 
Super glue LED chamber to the otoscope inner head. 

Feed wires through otoscope neck conduit.  Place otoscope inner head inside the otoscope outer head. 










Super glue the inner head piece on the outer head piece.
