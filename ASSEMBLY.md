# Otoscope Assembly Guide

This document outlines the manufacture of a high-quality low-cost open source otoscope. In this document, we will assemble main otoscope body, including the otoscope head, neck and battery area. Lens creation is [covered in a separate guide](LENS_ASSEMBLY.md).

You will need the following:

* Printed parts:
  * Battery holder
  * Button holder
  * Handle cover
  * Inner head
  * LED chamber
  * Outer head

* Other parts:
  * Completed [lens assembly](LENS_ASSEMBLY.md)
  * Battery compartment x 2 ([amazon]())
  * Momentary switch ([amazon]())
  * 
  * Cyanoacrylate glue ([amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Gorilla-7805201-20g-Super-Glue))
  * Clamps ([amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/TEKTON-3901-4-Inch-Opening-10-Piece))

## Step 1
Prepare printed parts and acquire other parts as necessary. Below are all required printed parts except for the handle cover.

## Step 2
Sand the bottom of the neck piece and the square holder area of the battery holder. Sand or file the connector appendage until a tight fit is achieved.

## Step 4
Prepare battery compartment. Roughly sand bottom of battery compartment for better glue exposure. Feed positive and negative wires through holes and solder connection between two holders to create one circuit.

## Step 5
Place wiring through the slot in the battery holder. Glue the battery compartments to the battery holder.

## Step 6
Prepare button.
	
Feed button wires through the button holder.  Placed button in the button holder and super glue.





Solder one button wire to the positive wire from battery holders. 








Create the LED chamber.





I placed a 220 ohm pull-up resistor here, I took this out after the fact because the lights were too dim. 











Super glue LED chamber bottom half. 
Super glue LED chamber to the otoscope inner head. 

Feed wires through otoscope neck conduit.  Place otoscope inner head inside the otoscope outer head. 










Super glue the inner head piece on the outer head piece. 










Connect otoscope head to battery part. 






Slide excess wire into neck section of otoscope. 
Super glue the two parts.
