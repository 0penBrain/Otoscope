In this document, I will explain how to make the lens part of the otoscope.
Start with pieces.

Shave off nub part of lens.






Place lens in jig #1.  Draw line from tops of jig.  Secure with masking tape. 
Dremel off excess above the line.







Take lens out of jig #1.  Put lens into jig #2.  ENSURE THAT THE PREVIOUSLY DREMELED SIDE WILL NOT BE DREMELED AGAIN WITH JIG #2! Draw line from tops of jig.  Secure with masking tape. 
Dremel off excess above jig #2.





Place lens in jig #3.
Secure with masking tape.






Dremel off sides.

Place lens in the large lens holder piece. Some slight dremel adjustments may need to be done in order to achieve a tight and secure fit. 




Dry fit with the smaller lens holder piece. 

Super glue the two parts together.  MAKE SURE NO SUPERGLUE TOUCHES THE LENS, OR ELSE IT WILL RUIN IT!
