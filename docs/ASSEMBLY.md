# Otoscope Assembly Guide

This document outlines the manufacture of a high-quality low-cost open source otoscope. In this document, we will assemble main otoscope body, including the otoscope head, neck and battery area. Lens creation is [covered in a separate guide](/docs/LENS_ASSEMBLY.md).

You will need the following:

* Printed parts (See [Print guide](/docs/PRINT_GUIDE.md)):
  * Battery holder
  * Button holder
  * Handle cover
  * LED chamber
  * Inner head
  * Outer head

* Other parts:
  * Completed [lens assembly](/docs/LENS_ASSEMBLY.md)
  * Battery compartment x 2 ([amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Scientific-Battery-Holder-Lead/dp/B00EPQK3DY))
  * Square pushbutton switch ([amazon]())
  * White LED lights x 6 ([amazon]())
  * Cyanoacrylate glue ([amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Gorilla-7805201-20g-Super-Glue/dp/B00K2N525I))
  * Clamps ([amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/TEKTON-3901-4-Inch-Opening-10-Piece/dp/B00BRL59UM))
  * Soldering iron
  * Solder
  * Small gauge wire
  * Electrical tape or shrinkwrap wire cover

## Step 1
Prepare printed parts and acquire other parts as necessary. Below are all required printed parts except for the handle cover and the bottom half of the LED chamber. All pieces should be printed in black, but the LED chamber top can be printed in white for extra LED light reflectance.

## Step 2
Sand the bottom of the neck piece and the square holder area of the battery holder. Sand or file the connector appendage until a tight fit is achieved.

## Step 3
Glue the neck piece and the battery compartment

## Step 4
Prepare battery compartment. Roughly sand bottom of battery compartment for better glue exposure.

## Step 5
Place wiring through the slot in the battery holder. Glue the battery compartments to the battery holder.

## Step 6
Prepare button. Feed button wires through the button holder. Placed button in the button holder and glue.

## Step 7
Solder one button wire to the positive wire from battery holders.

## Step 8
Create the LED chamber. The current design does not use a resistor.

## Step 9
Solder the positive leads of the LEDs together in parallel and the negative leads together, also in parallel.

## Step 10
Glue LED chamber bottom half using CA glue or something similar.

## Step 11
Glue LED chamber to the otoscope inner head using CA glue or similar.

## Step 12
Feed wires through otoscope neck conduit. Place otoscope inner head inside the otoscope outer head.

## Step 13
Glue the inner head piece on the outer head piece using CA glue or similar.

## Step 14
Solder the wires on the otoscope head to the body's wires, taking care to match polarity.

## Step 15
Slide excess wire into neck section of otoscope and glue the two parts with CA glue or similar.
